Probabilities: from 0'005 to 0'1, by 0'005.
Number of simulations: 500 for each probability

Number of nodes: 100
r = 0'5
k = 0'75
dn = 0'75
A: uniform distribution between 0 and 1
B: uniform distribution between 0 and 1
Initial conditions: one infected node with an initial viral load between 0 and 0'375

Graphs generated by death_interval.R:
	death_intervals.jpg: shows the time interval between the first and last deaths.
	infected.jpg: shows the number of infected nodes by the time the first node dies, and the number of infected nodes by the time the last nodes dies.
	infected_difference.jpg: shows the difference between the number of infected nodes by the time the first node dies and the number of infected nodes by the time the last node dies.
	infected_difference_regression.jpg: shows the same as infected_difference, but in this case using a regression line. This regression line is drawn using the gam (generalized additive mode) method, using a cubic regression spline.

On infected.jpg, we can see that the curves seem to reach the plateau when the probability is similar to the probability corresponding to the maximum number of dead nodes

Graphs generated by curve_comparison.R: 
	curve_comparison.jpg: shows the regression line drawn in infected_difference_regression, and another regression line (drawn using the same method as the first) corresponding to the number of final dead nodes with dn = 0'75
	
From curve_comparsion.jpg, we can see that using the data contained in infected.jpg we can get a very good approximation to the number of death nodes,
